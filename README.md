# Covid-SQL
SQL project for COVID data exploration involve analyzing dataset containing information about COVID cases and deaths in various regions or countries. 
The first step was to import the dataset into SQL database and create a table to store the data. 
The table include fields for relevant information such as region, date, confirmed cases, deaths, and testing rates.
Once the data is stored in the SQL database, various queries and analyses was performed to gain insights into the data. 
For example, an SQL query was written to retrieve the total number of COVID cases and deaths for a particular region or country.


Additionally an SQL queries was used to compare COVID data across different regions or countries, identify trends or patterns in the data, and then visualize the data using Tableau. 

Overall, this SQL project for COVID data exploration was able to provide valuable insights into the spread and impact of the COVID pandemic, as well as inform policy and public health decisions.
